qshutdown


INSTALL:
========

Dependencies: libqt4-dev, libqt4-dbus, build-essential

If you want to install from source, open a terminal and change into this folder.
To install type:

qmake
sudo make install distclean


For admins:
You can enable "parental lock" for every user if you do the following:

sudo cp /usr/share/qshutdown/autostart/99qshutdown /etc/X11/Xsession.d/

now add the following line to the sudoers (for example with "EDITOR=nano sudo -E visudo"):

* ALL = NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/qshutdown

the * replaces the username or %groupname (Don't forget the % if it's a group).

And one more thing:
Edit the /root/.qshutdown/qshutdown.conf (after starting qshutdown once as root) and set
the option Lock_all to true.

If you should ever forget your set password, just remove the whole line
starting with "Password" manually from the qshutdown.conf.


UNINSTALL:
==========

To uninstall type:

qmake     (if the Makefile has been removed)
sudo make deinstall

(note that ~/.qshutdown/qshutdown.conf and
 ~/.qshutdown/log.txt won't be removed)


KNOWN ISSUES:
=============

There is no system tray icon for qshutdown in Ubuntu 11.04.
SOLUTION: Type the following line in a terminal:

gsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Panel systray-whitelist "['all']"

In case you want to use the sudo shutdown command and you have set
the rights in the sudoers, but it still doesn't work, please specify
your own command in the preferences and try if "sudo shutdown -hP" now works.

For most systems using the Gnome Shell a certain DBus method has been removed,
thus a shutdown dialog will be likely to appear if qshutdown's methods have
been set to automatic or to Gnome session. If you do not want this
shutdown dialog to appear, please use ConsoleKit or something else.



HINTS ON USAGE:
===============

One can not close qshutdown, but only quit it using the sytem tray icon (indicator) or
the key combination Ctrl+Q (see shortcuts). If you want qshutdown to stop bugging you,
just remove the hook from warnings on?


HOTKEYS:
==========

Ctrl+I	information window
Ctrl+Q	Quit
Ctrl+P	Prefereces
Ctrl+L	write the run time once into the logfile (works only if qshutdown quits. To make it permanent set it in the preferences.)
Ctrl+S	set to shutdown
Ctrl+R	set to restart
Ctrl+U	set to suspend to RAM
Ctrl+H	set to hibernate
Ctrl+E	stop timer (only if the countdown has started and the admin didn't restrict the access)
Shift+E	to edit the config file (for this a password is necessary. If you are a user, you can set an "empty password" (leave the password field empty)).

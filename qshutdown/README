qshutdown


INSTALL:
========

Depencies: libqt4-dev, libqt4-dbus, build-essential

If you want to install from source, open a terminal and change into this folder.
To install type:

qmake
make
sudo make install distclean


For admins:
You can enable "parental lock" for every user if you do the following:

sudo cp /usr/share/qshutdown/autostart/99qshutdown /etc/X11/Xsession.d/

now add the following line to the sudoers (for example with "EDITOR=nano sudo -E visudo"):

* ALL = NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/qshutdown

the * replaces the username or %groupname (Don't forget the % if it's a group).

And one more thing:
Edit the /root/.qshutdown/qshutdown.conf (after starting qshutdown once as root) and set
the option Lock_all to true.

If you should ever forget your set password, just remove the whole line
starting with "Password" manually from the qshutdown.conf.


UNINSTALL:
==========

To uninstall type:

qmake     (if the Makefile has been removed)
sudo make deinstall

(note that ~/.qshutdown/qshutdown.conf and
 ~/.qshutdown/log.txt won't be removed)


KNOWN ISSUES:
=============

There is no system tray icon for qshutdown in Ubuntu 11.04.
SOLUTION: Type the following line in a terminal:

gsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Panel systray-whitelist "['all']"



HINTS ON USAGE:
===============

One can not close qshutdown, but only quit it using the sytem tray icon (indicator) or
the key combination Ctrl+Q (see shortcuts). If you want qshutdown to stop bugging you,
just remove the hook from warnings on?


HOTKEYS:
==========

Ctrl+I	information window
Ctrl+Q	Quit
Ctrl+P	Prefereces
Ctrl+L	write the run time once into the logfile (works only if qshutdown quits. To make it permanent set it in the preferences.)
Ctrl+S	set to shutdown
Ctrl+R	set to restart
Ctrl+U	set to suspend to RAM
Ctrl+H	set to hibernate
Ctrl+E	stop timer (only if the countdown has started and the admin didn't restrict the access)
Shift+E	to edit the config file (for this a password is necessary. If you are a user, you can set an "empty password" (leave the password field empty)).

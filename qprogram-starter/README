KNOWN ISSUE:
=============

For most systems using the Gnome Shell a certain DBus method has been removed,
thus a shutdown dialog will be likely to appear if qshutdown's methods have
been set to automatic or to Gnome session. If you do not want this
shutdown dialog to appear, please use ConsoleKit or something else.
